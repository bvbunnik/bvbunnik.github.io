## Biography
My research focuses on the understanding spread of infectious diseases using mathematical models, statistical modelling and Next Generation Sequencing. I am particular interested in the use of new techniques and technology to gain knowledge on the temporal and spatial spread of antibiotic resistance on all scales and gaining insights in how we can eliminate rabies by modelling (roaming) dog populations in countries where it is still endemic.

Using a combination of (experimental) data, mathematical modelling, statistical modelling and whole genome sequencing data, I hope to gain better understanding of, and insight in, the mechanisms that underlie (both spatial and temporal) spread of diseases.

I received my MSc in Biology from the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, after which I started as a PhD-student at the department of Quantitative Veterinary Epidemiology of Wageningen University and Central Veterinary Institute in Lelystad, where I researched the spread of pathogen between spatially separated hosts.
